## Introduction

This document provides a step-by-step guide to setting up APISwan for automated regression testing alongside your main application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [ ] A Dockerized version of your main application.
- [ ] [Goreplay](https://github.com/buger/goreplay) running as a sidecar container along with the main application.
- [ ] APISwan client and UI binary executable files
- [ ] APISwan Client ID

## Installation
### Step 1: Setup Goreplay
Follow these guides to setup goreplay based on your existing tech stack:
1. [AWS - Using Elastic Container Service (ECS)](goreplay-ecs.md)
2. [AWS - Using Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](goreplay-eks.md)
3. [GCP - Using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](goreplay-gke.md)
4. [Docker](goreplay-docker.md)
5. [Kubernetes](goreplay-kubernetes.md)

### Step 2: APISwan Executables
For configuring APISwan, you will require the following executable files:
1. APISwan Client
2. APISwan App

### Step 3: APISwan - Client
The client's responsibilities include the following:
1. Monitoring the log file generated by GoReplay.
2. Creating and executing the regression test suite.

In addition to the client executable, you will need to create a `config.json` file inside the `client` directory to tailor the client's configuration to your specific needs. This file has the following keys:
- `auth_token` (required): Your token for client authentication.
- `encryption_key` (recommended): Custom AES256 encryption generated by the end user. It should be of exactly 32 characters (each from 0-9).
- `replay_host_url` (optional): The url of the application which needs to be tested.
- `client_port` (optional): The port number at which `apiswan-client` will listen to.


Here's an example configuration:
```json
{
    "encryption_key": "01234567890123456789012345678901",
    "replay_host_url": "http://localhost:8080",
    "client_port": "9080"
    "auth_token": "<client token>"
}
```

To Start the client:
```
sudo ./apiswan-client
```


### Step 4: Goreplay
Make sure that the goreplay is present inside the `client` directory.

```
sudo ./gor --input-raw :8080 --input-raw-track-response --output-file swan-%d-%H-%M-%S.log
```

### Step 5: APISwan - Web App
Launch the app binary file to access the user interface.
```
serve -s -l 3000 apiswan-ui
```

## Testing

To simulate traffic, manually call various API endpoints of your application. Navigate to the app and trigger a "swan event" to observe the regression test in action.
