## 1. Introduction

This document provides a step-by-step guide to setting up GoReplay as a sidecar alongside your main application in an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS). GoReplay is a versatile tool for capturing and replaying HTTP traffic, useful for various debugging and testing scenarios.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [ ] An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- [ ] AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured.
- [ ] A Dockerized version of your main application.
- [ ] Basic knowledge of Kubernetes and Amazon EKS.

## 3. Step 1: Set Up AWS Environment

Set up your AWS environment, including Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, security groups, and any necessary IAM roles. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create and manage resources in AWS.

## 4. Step 2: Create an Amazon EKS Cluster

Create an Amazon EKS cluster where you will deploy your containers. Use the AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console to create the cluster. Make sure to configure worker nodes for your cluster to run your containers.

## 5. Step 3: Containerize Your Main Application

Dockerize your main application if it's not already containerized. Build the Docker image and push it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) or a similar container registry.

## 6. Step 4: Define Kubernetes Deployments

Create Kubernetes deployment configurations that include both your main application container and the GoReplay container as sidecars. Refer to the provided example YAML configuration for guidance.

**Deployment YAML Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: main-app
          image: <your-ecr-repo>/main-app:latest
        - name: goreplay-sidecar
          image: goreplay/goreplay
          args:
            - "--input-raw :8080"
            - "--input-raw-track-response"
            - "--output-file swan-%d-%H-%M-%S.log"
```

Adjust the container names, images, and arguments as needed. In this example, GoReplay captures traffic on port 8080 and logs it as .log files.

## 7. Step 5: Configure GoReplay

Configure GoReplay by specifying its arguments within the Kubernetes deployment configuration. Customize GoReplay's options according to your specific use case, such as specifying capture and replay settings.

## 8. Step 6: Deploy the Application with GoReplay

Apply the deployment configuration to create the pods with your main application and GoReplay sidecar:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

## 9. Step 7: Testing

Thoroughly test the setup to ensure that GoReplay is capturing and replaying traffic as expected. Use tools like curl or automated test suites to validate the behavior.

## 10. Step 8: Monitoring and Logging

Set up monitoring and logging for your application and GoReplay to track their performance and behavior. You can use Amazon CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray, or other AWS services for this purpose.

## 11. Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up GoReplay as a sidecar alongside your main application in an Amazon EKS cluster on AWS. Ensure that you monitor and maintain your deployment for ongoing performance and reliability.

For additional information and advanced configuration options, refer to the official GoReplay documentation and AWS EKS documentation.
